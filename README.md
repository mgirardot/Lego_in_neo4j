# Build Star Wars models with your Lego collection

Since my childhood, the countless model building with Lego bricks are fascinating me. Lego are plastic construction toys consisting of interlocking bricks that are used to construct a wide variety of models. Usually, Lego are sold as a collection of different designed pieces and an instruction book that visually describe the sequential building steps of a miniature model. 

I always had a great fun using bricks to build different models that you have to imagine based on the bricks available. But this liberty to imagine new models comes with a great frustration when important pieces are missing to build it.

Here I used neo4j to store a sample of the Star Wars Lego collection. Using this graph database I can predict which model can be build using the parts of the models I own. Interestingly, I can find out which parts are missing in my collection to build a new model.

_This project was developed for the Graphgist Challenge at [Neo4j](http://portal.graphgist.org/challenge/index.html)_

The AsciiDoc file `Lego_sets.adoc` is interpreted at the [graphgist portal](http://portal.graphgist.org/graph_gists/build-star-wars-models-with-your-lego-collection)

Here is the result of the [challenge](http://neo4j.com/blog/graphgist-challenge-winners/). My graphgist has been awarded in the holidays category. Many thanks to Neo4j and the judges (Kevin Van Gundy, Nicole White, William Lyon, Jonatan JÃ¤derberg and Luanne Misquitta).
